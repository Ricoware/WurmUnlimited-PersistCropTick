# WurmUnlimited-PersistCropTick
Saves the CropTilePoller time to the mod database and reads it in on server start.

Options in the .properties file will enable/disable the player commands (see below) and the display of the next crop tick on login.

Commands /chirp, /nextchirp, /nexttick, or /nextcrop will display the current time to next farm tick.

GM command (power level 4 or higher) /setCropTickNow will set the crop tick to the current time plus one second.

This mod should NOT be used on the same server as the CropInfo mod.
